go-openxc is a simple Go library for working with the [OpenXC](https://github.com/openxc) Platform.

This implementation is far less mature than the official libraries and bindings
provided by the OpenXC project, but is a first step in enabling the use of
OpenXC in Go applications.

The interfaces have further been designed with extensibility in mind, allowing
for additional data sources to be added, as well as to allow OpenXC messaging
and vehicle information embedding in more complex applications while remaining
compliant with the OpenXC messaging specification.

## Installation

Install:

```shell
go get -u github.com/adaptant-labs/go-openxc
```

Import:

```go
import "github.com/adaptant-labs/go-openxc"
```

## Testing and Contributing

Note that this is only an initial implementation of a subset of the OpenXC API
to facilitate working with OpenXC datasets. It is by no means a feature complete
implementation of the API, and is expected to grow gradually and incrementally
as it begins to be used in other projects.

For issues with the current implementation, feature requests, or general
wishlist items, feel free to open an issue, or, better yet, submit a pull
request.

## Online Documentation

Online API documentation is provided through godoc, this can be accessed
directly on the [package entry](https://godoc.org/github.com/adaptant-labs/go-openxc)
in the godoc package repository.

## Logo

The go-openxc gopher logo is a modification of the gopher vector image by Takuya Ueda ([https://twitter.com/tenntenn](https://github.com/golang-samples/gopher-vector/blob/master/README.md#gopher)), superimposed with the OpenXC logo from the OpenXC Platform Media Kit ([http://openxcplatform.com/overview/media.html](http://openxcplatform.com/overview/media.html)).
